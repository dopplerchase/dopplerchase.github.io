<h2> Ozone transport by storms in the Amazon </h2>
<i> 2014 - 2015 </i>

My first topic of research was with the transport of ozone within storms over the Amazon rainforest. This was when I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates at Penn State University where I worked with [Dr. Jose Fuentes](https://www.ems.psu.edu/directory/jose-fuentes).

The general idea was that the rainforest is a natural sink for ozone, so ozone levels often were near 0 ppb. When a storm forms and with it a downdraft, this downdraft would mix ozone from the free troposphere into the boundry layer. The largest example is shown in the plot above (from my poster). This example shows an increase of ozone from 10 to 50 ppb.
