This page is some additional information about topics of research I have explored in the past. The TL;DR is I went from ozone transport in the amazon, to radar retrievals of snow, to machine learning for general meteorologists and severe weather. 

<h2> Machine Learning for Meteorology (Postdoc) </h2>
<i> 2021 - 2023 </i>

After dabbling in machine learning for my PhD, I went on to do machine learning as the focus of my research as a postdoc at the University of Oklahoma (remotely) working with Amy McGovern. 

<h2> Global Precipitation Measurement mission snowfall (PhD) </h2>
<i> 2018 - 2021 </i>

During my masters a [paper](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/58/7/jamc-d-18-0124.1.xml?tab_body=pdf) came out by Gail Skofronick-Jackson showing the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission's estimates of snowfall globally was vastly underpredicting what CloudSat was measuring. Seeing this, my advisers and I thought it would be good to investigate why GPM's snowfall was so much smaller than CloudSat. My PhD then can be grouped into 3 parts (and 3 papers): 

1) Why is the current radar retrieval of snowfall deficient? <br>
2) Can we create an alternate retrieval that improves snowfall estimates? <br>
3) How well does the new alternate retrieval work compared to CloudSat? <br>

<h2> Triple Frequency Radar Observations (MS) </h2>
<i> 2016 - 2018 </i>

For my masters work, I was hired to work on analyzing NASA field campaign data that was collected for the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission. One insturment that was used during these campaigns was the Airborne Precipitation Radar (pictured above). One especially novel thing from these field camapigns was that this radar observed clouds at 3 wavelengths, all collocated. These 3 wavelengths were Ku-, Ka- and W-band. Having 3 different wavelengths helps constrain our retrievals of things like snow amounts, snow particle size etc. 

This was the first time that an airborne platform used these 3 frequencies together, and previous ground based efforts showed the 3 frequencies could help determine snow habit, i.e., aggregate vs rimed particle. What I did was explore how the new airborne data compared to the ground based work, and also include some coincident in-situ observations from a second aircraft.

What we found in my first peer-review publication ([Chase et al. 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL077997)) that these new airborne observations compare well to the previous ground based efforts. More specifically, the dual-frequency ratio space (differences between radar frequencies) can seperate particle effective size and effective density (i.e., seperate aggregates vs graupel).

<h2> Ozone transport by storms in the Amazon (BS) </h2>
<i> 2014 - 2015 </i>

My first topic of research was with the transport of ozone within storms over the Amazon rainforest. This was when I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates at Penn State University where I worked with [Dr. Jose Fuentes](https://www.ems.psu.edu/directory/jose-fuentes). 

![OzonePoster](/assets/images/PosterResult_Ozone.png) 

The general idea was that the rainforest is a natural sink for ozone, so ozone levels often were near 0 ppbv. When a storm forms and with it a downdraft, this downdraft would mix ozone from the free troposphere into the boundry layer. The largest example is shown in the plot above (from my poster). This example shows an increase of ozone from 10 to 50 ppbv. 

This work culminated in posters at the 2014 and 2015 AMS annual meetings.
