My current research centers on using machine learning with remote sensing from space. I work on two primary grants, Satellite-based 3D global cloud field analysis (OVERCAST) sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, and INvestigation of Convective UpdraftS (INCUS) sponsored by NASA.

In the past few years, data-driven models have emerged showing promising skill for various weather forecasting tasks.
